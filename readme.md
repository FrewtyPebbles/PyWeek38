# Unfinished Game

Unfortunately I will be unable to finish my entry in time.  This is due to multiple factors that I foresaw being a potential obstacle from the beginning.  Other than work getting especially busy this week, my game engine [Loxoc](https://pypi.org/project/Loxoc/) is still in development versions and because of this I have prioritized bug fixing and polishing the engine over everything else during the jam.  Nevertheless I am glad to have been able to participate in PyWeek38.  This game jam has helped me discover many bugs with my engine and flesh out engine features from a new perspective.  As the first ever actual attempt at making a game with my engine, I am happy with how it performed despite the obstacles that came along the way.  In many ways it performed better than I expected it to.  I am excited to continue development on my engine and hope by next time PyWeek comes around I will be better prepared with a more robust version of my engine that wont require during-the-jam maintenance.

TLDR: I prioritized bug-fixing and further engine development based on the requirements of my game.  Because of this I ran out of time to finish my entry.  I'll be more prepared next time.

To run the test file install the [Loxoc](https://pypi.org/project/Loxoc/) dependency and run the main file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

Controls:

 * WASD to move.

 * Mouse to look.

 * E to interact and pick up objects.

 * Click to shoot (Although it doesnt really do anything at the moment).

The supported platforms are Windows and Linux, although in the future I plan on releasing [Loxoc](https://pypi.org/project/Loxoc/) wheels for MacOS aswel.

Heres a gif of the test scene for those curious:
